# CanadaPostReview_SentimentAnalysis
The problem we aim to address in this data science project is to perform sentiment analysis on customer reviews for Canada Post. By analyzing a diverse set of reviews from Google, Reddit, and Trust Pilot, we seek to gain valuable insights into the perceptions of customers towards each courier service.
